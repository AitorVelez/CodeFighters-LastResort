## Game Description


Last Resort is a sci-fi horizontally-scrolling shoot 'em up developed and released by for Arcades, Neo Geo, 1992.
Last Resort takes place in a era of space colonization. When a mysterious computer virus infects human's automated defense system, the pilots of two fighter ships must stop it. 
The game draws inspiration from the R-Type series. 

## Gameplay description

In the game, you pilot a ship in a side-scrolling stage, constantly shooting at the assailing enemies.
Movement is controlled with a four-way joystick, with one button to shoot and launch the Unit, a satellite weapon, and another button to lock or release the Unit's orbit. 
The Unit always moves and fires opposite the direction of the ship's movement; the second button on the controller can be used to stop its rotation in place, or to start it again. When the fire button is held down, releasing it will launch the Unit away from the ship.
After launching away, the Unit quickly rejoins the ship. Enemies that appear from all angles and each stage culminates in a fight against a boss.

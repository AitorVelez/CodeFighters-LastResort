#Game Description

Last Resort is a sci-fi horizontally-scrolling shoot 'em up developed and released by SNK for arcades (running Neo Geo MVS hardware) on March 23, 1992.

Set in the futuristic 2920, Last Resort takes place in an era of space colonization. When a mysterious computer virus infects human's automated defense system, it's up to the pilots of two fighter ships (the TZ-024 and YS-024) to stop it.

The game draws heavy inspiration from the R-Type series, most notably the ability to control a satellite (called the "high-orbital unit") that orbits around each player's ship and is used to both deflect shots and increase firepower.

The game was later released for the Neo Geo AES on April 24, 1992 and ported to the Neo Geo CD on September 9, 1994 (as a launch title).




We are going to 'emulate' the arcade game Last Resort, as the aim of project 1 subject in CITM.
